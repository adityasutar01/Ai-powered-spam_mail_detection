AI‑Powered Spam Mail Detection
🚀 A web-based application to classify email messages as spam or ham (legitimate), powered by AI and deployed on Render.

🎯 Project Overview
This project uses artificial intelligence to analyze the content of emails and determine whether they are spam or not. It provides a user-friendly web interface for testing fast, delivering near-instant results. Built with modern web tech and deployed on Render.

🧪 Key Features
Fast text-based email classification: Classifies messages instantly via a web UI.

AI-powered model: Uses machine learning (e.g. Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or a neural pipeline) to score emails.

Interactive UI: Input messages and immediately receive predictions.

Production deployment: Hosted on Render for scalable and reliable access.

📦 Tech Stack
Layer	Technologies
Frontend	React + Vite
Build tool	Vite
Backend (if any)	Node.js API (optional)
Machine Learning	Scikit-learn / NLP classifier
Deployment	Render (web service / static)

⚙️ Installation & Local Setup
Use the following steps to run the project locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/adityasutar01/Ai-powered-spam_mail_detection.git  
cd Ai-powered-spam_mail_detection  
npm install  
npm run build          # Build production version  
npm run preview        # Preview on http://localhost:4173  
🌐 Deployment on Render
⚙️ Static Site Host (if no backend)
Build command: npm run build

Publish directory: dist


⚙️ Web Service Mode (if using Node backend)
Add this start script in package.json:

json
Copy
Edit
"start": "vite preview --port 8080"
Set Start Command in Render dashboard to:
npm run start


🚴‍♀️ How It Works (Hypothetical Flow)
User enters an email message into the web interface.

The text is sent to the backend (or client side logic).

Features (like TF–IDF or embeddings) are extracted.

The trained model predicts spam or ham.

UI displays the result with confidence score.



🧠 Model & Data (Explainable as needed)
Model Types: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or other classifier.

Data: Trained on publicly available or curated datasets with labeled emails.

Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, vectorization.



📈 Results & Performance
Expected spam-detection accuracy: up to ~98% on test sets (based on standard benchmarks)

✅ Usage & Contribution
Feel free to clone, test, and build upon this project!

To retrain the model:

Prepare a dataset of labeled emails.

Retrain your chosen classifier.

Swap in the newly trained model.

Contributions (bug fixes, UI improvements, new model integration) are very welcome. Just open a PR on the GitHub repo.
